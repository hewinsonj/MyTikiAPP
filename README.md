Overview:

"MyTiki" is an app that provides 10 classic tiki cocktail recipes that are available to be viewed by any logged in user. The user is also able to customize any of the provided recipies and add them to their own "original cocktails" folder, or create their own from scratch! The user also has the ability to filter the shown cocktails by keywords, and add any cocktails they wish to their "favorites" folder. This app will be built using Mongoose, Liquid.js and Bootstrap.
